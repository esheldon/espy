scat
-----------------

scat-08 is a new version of basically regauss scat-06 which was lost when hdfs
was lost.

sdss redmapper 5.10
-------------------

TODO
    - make scat 09 with R corrected errors
    - add R_range and possibly mag_range to configs to make cuts
    - second best center with default source catalog
        * andres run his stuff: corr first?
    - run with a higher s/n source catalog
    - run a purely uniform random set just to look at additive systematics

The label * means not yet run

- lcat-rm06
    - redmapper 5.10 best center
* lcat-rm07 running
    - redmapper 5.10 second best center
    - run
    - bin
    * match randoms
    * correct

- run-rm06s08
    - redmapper rm06 with scat 08 
* run-rm07s08
    - redmapper rm07 with scat 08

- lcat-rmrand02
    - redmapper 5.10 randoms

* lcat-sdssrand04
    - truly uniform randoms with redshifts that go with redmapper 5.10


Run run-r01 should be thought of as run-sdssrand01 It uses lcat-sdssrand01,
which has no strict edgecut, only the quad cut
This random run can be used for run-08
