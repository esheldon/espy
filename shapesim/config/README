    sims
        et01
            - am running et01r05 with add to cache, 1000 per.
        dt01
            - have about 100-200 per as of now.  Some with same seeds.

    ring sims

        gg03
            - ring, shear g1=0.01, 1000 in ring, but ring/s2 ratios seem
            incomplete?

    low noise runs
        et01r04
            - very glad I reran the 03 run with better guesses, this one looks
              great

    noisy runs
        S/N
        100
            et01r05
                - with noise, we might want to interpolate the par results from
                  et01r04, let's see first.
            dt01r06 
                - only 100 realizations, need more
