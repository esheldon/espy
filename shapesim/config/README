gmix-fit

    cbafit
        - often seeing big outliers, and seeing bias at low s/n
            - outliers
                - could be because of not burning in (see runs geg04*)
                - could be some error in calculating PQR
            - bias at low s/n, inconsistent with what we saw with the python+C
              code
            - why did the nersc run look so bad?

        - deg03*
            - g style, lensfit calculated, prior ba13, size ratio 2
        - deg05*
            - g style, lensfit calculated, prior ba13, size ratio sqrt(2)
            6-10 didn't start due to star shutdown

            - note deg08r10 didn't finish due to star upgrade.

        - geg01r*
            - initial runs with eta.  show significant bias

            - redoing r01 with fix from below cutting off low prob values
                - looks better but still shit
            - trying r02 with more error checking

        - geg02r*
            - initial runs with g.  show significant bias, even at high s/n
            - the runs 06, 07, 08 (nersc) and 09 10 (bnl) use the newer code that
              distributes the guess across the prior

            r11
                - using long double for some logl() calculations
                - not cutting off prob low values so low
                    - that was the trick.  Now just checking that P > 0
                        and 1/P finite.
                - nsplit 355, s2n_fac 100, min_npair 800
            r10 also using same code as r11. r01 r02 running at nersc

            r03 has additional error checking
            r04
            r05,r06,r07 r08,r09 condor

            ***** r08 (and others) looks bizarre and seem to have bin-to-bin
            correlations in errors!  Re-doing r08 with better random number
            generator, also new one r12 on normal cluster, r13 on condor

                - r08 still has correlations in errors
                - r12
                - r13 looks about same as r08
                - r14 running on condor
                - r15 running on astro

        - geg03r*
            - for quick tests
            - r01 is currently testing gmix3 with the added error checking

        - geg04r*
            - nsplit 356 or 355, s2n_fac 100
            r01 -
                - using bafit-geg03.cfg which has burnin=800
                - no difference 
    bafit

        - fitting bd to exp.  Works ok for flux it seems, need to 
        do full run to check shear

            - also it seems to have tau and acor problems pretty often at high
              s/n

        - I worry the sampling is not good?

        - tried coellip; quick look it is very good at high s/n but a check at
          s/n 25 or so looked terrible (0.03 error)

        - seeing offset ~0.003 at high s/n. Turns out it is the 2nd order
          approximation!  Running gg15 with shear 0.01

            sim-gg15
            bafit-gg15r01,r02,r03 and combined

            - interestingly, miller method does not suffer this,
              nor does maximum likelihood...

        - also lm fitter
            gmix-fit-gg15r01


        - doing exp with single gauss psf
            sim-geg01
            bafit-geg01r01


        - bafit-geg01r02 with prior during to see if we get better results for
          old miller method

        - bafit-geg02r03 prior during and s2n_fac=160

            was fitting 2 gauss, try fitting 1 gauss as well?

        old
        - bafit-geg01r04 fitting 1 gauss, s2n_fac 160, min_gcount 400, prior during
        - bafit-geg01r05 fitting 1 gauss, s2n_fac 160, min_gcount 400, prior after

        - bafit-geg02r01 s2n_fac 160, min_gcount 400, prior after
            - trying bigger psf.  Tried 1 gauss, doesn't look any better.
            - modified in place to use 2 gauss, trying now.
            about the same
        
        - try gg, if this has same bias it is somehow related to using an
          exponential or the fitting technique

            sim-gg13
            bafit-gg13r01

        - trying gmix-fit
            gmix-fit-gg13r01
            same error

            trying with tighter tolerance, 1.0e-8
            nope

            trying with 2 gauss

            trying lm2
                different error....  running 019 with 8000 to see
                nope, got 0.002 now.  try 1 gauss?

            maybe it is still noise bias?

                trying s/n=10,000

                nope

        gg08r05 fix T/cen, ngrid 22, -0.9,0.9
        gg08r06 averaged with r05
        gg08r07 should be consistent with above, just using
            faster likelihood code.  Looks fine.
        gg08r08 marginalize over T.    See notes in 
            bayesfit_sim.py

                doesn't look as good as gg10r07
            gg10r12 - to be averaged with gg10r11
            gg10r13 - tried temperature but had wrong formula
            gg10r14 - increased number *after* burning to 
                better sample the tail.  This looks pretty good!
            gg10r15 - same as gg10r14 for averaging

            get01r04 - Doing test with new code, make sure not crazy

            gdt01r01 - looks terrible
            gdt01r02 gdt01r03 gdt01r04 for averaging

            gdt01r05 - improved dev model
            gdt01r06,,gdt01r07,gdt01r08 for averaging
                - looks better, less biased than the LM code
                but still biased

            gdt01r09 - more steps after burning
                - checked 0 0, not much difference
            gdt01r10 - more burnin
                - checked 0 0, not much difference
            gdt01r11 - more burnin *and* steps
                - did a full run, might be a little better.
            gdt01r12 - More walkers: 40 walkers but still
                400 burning per and 400 steps per
                ran (1, 1) for a check
                LOOKS LIKE SHIT
            
            Trying to also marginalize over amplitude

            get01r05 - first exp with amp marg
                - looks better for 0,0, doing a ful run
                - forgot to use new seed, RERUN
                    and do some more for averaging tonight
                    get01r06,get01r07,get01r08

            - first dev with amp marg 
                gdt01r13 
                - Doing a full run: looks about the same

                - maybe try temperature higher?
                    - gdt01r14 - running 0 0  looks crazy

                - maybe try prior after?  Perhaps the 1/prior
                  causing problems for dev?
                    - gdt01r15 doing full run
                    actually looks a little better but noisy

                - might need more walkers with higher dim space
                    am using the "minimum" of 2*6=12 (althoug
                    this worked fine for exp!)
                    -gdt01r16 nwalkers 40, prior during
                        - running 0,0
                    looks about the same

            -fix exp to dev?  Just curious, but quick look shows it will
            greatly underestimate the size. 
                - running gdt01r18
                - it did just as well at s/n=20!

            - but that does make me wonder if I should just limit
            the radius used for calculations?  I forgot to put that in!
                gdt01r19, same as r13 but trimmed
                worse: I checked and I was using the underlying T to
                get image size.

            - fixed bug, now T convolved to get image size
                gdt01r20.  didn't help, so I'm turning on
                some other things I think might help: more walkers
                after prior and using 80 walkers with 200/200
                no better

            - the average T values are way too big in the gdev fit.
            Maybe applying some kind of sanity prior would help.

            - also instead of a hard prior at 0 on T, something that goes
              smoothly to zero?  Trying a fairly tight lognormal prior on T
                - gdt01r21
                looks about the same!

                - gdt01r22
                    even tighter T prior  accidantally used
                        40/200/200 so it's gonna take twice as long
                        used fixed width 1.e-6
                - gdt01r23
                    Using prior width 0.1*T  This is still quite tight
                    compared to the mcmc chain distribution for s/n=10
                    
                    This does look better indeed
                - gdt01r24
                    Using prior width 1*T to see if this just helps prevent
                    crazy T values.  
                    

            - gdt02 - 10 gaussians for dev
                gdt02r01 - straight run
                gdt02r02 - using log10(T) as variable
                    - The errors on the shape are larger, but at fixed error
                    the systematics are better.  Need more statistics
                    Why is the error larger?
                gdt02r03 - same as r01 for more statistics
                gdt02r05 - same as r01 for more statistics
                gdt02r04 - same as r02 for more statistics
                gdt02r06 - same as r02 for more statistics

                gdt02r07 - using eta as parametrization: the e values are all
                    at -1,1 with no prior.  May be because thereis just more
                    area out there and the likelihoods are hardly different.

                    running with prior during to see if mitigates this.

                Idea: run with prior after and look at the width
                    of *eta* might be the best indicator, even better
                    than the width on g. It is so broad it is causing
                    proglems for the gsens calculation!

                    PROBLEM: the mcmc just doesn't seem to move well
                    in eta space, often never burned in at low s/n

             Idea:  the error without the prior on g1,g2 may be the
             best indicator of badness
                gdt02r08 - prior after and keeping g0 and gcov0 for later use

                - rerun since we added pre-fit and more burnin?

                gdt02r11 - looks fairly unbiased.  Note implemented doing the
                fitter as first step since at high s/n convergence was slow
                gdt02r12 and gdt02r13 for averaging.  Need more!  Note because
                if wierd errors with file system, probably better to run
                more smaller s2n_fac, but I'll need *lots* of them!  These
                three represent 20+40+40. To double would need 5 more 20s

                - with noise, we might want to interpolate the par results from
                  et01r04, let's see first.

                - only 100 realizations, need more
