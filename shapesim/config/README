                NEED to tell story of how error is a function
                of ellipticity, but we haven't run the sims 
                for byellip with different S/N.

        ring test with no shear and non-circular PSF using dg
        ring tests with dg psf
        plotting: do cumulative s2 averages, s2 < X

        et03, which had trimming, ran much faster.  If it was also accurate, we
        should maybe use it instead of et02, which deswl is super slow.
