        - et03, which had trimming, ran much faster.  If it was also accurate,
          we should maybe use it instead of et02, which deswl is super slow.

        - gg04r01, r02, r03 rerun with s2n_fac=10?

        - I'm seeing some additive bias for edg03 shear=0.  Do a couple more
          sims with different g1 and map it all out?
