zinput-{photo_sample}.json
    photo_sample: The photometric smaple, e.g. "01"
    proctype: for sdss this is "sdssgal"
    procrun: processing run, used to open columns db,e.g. "prim04"
    cmodel_rmin: minimum cmodel mag
    cmodel_rmax:
    modelmag_min: min and max mags for all model mags
    modelmag_max:
    weighting: This is for weighting zphot
    masktype: e.g. "tycho"
    filetype: usually "rec"

train-{train_sample}.json
    photo_sample: the photometric sample to use
    sdss_rmax:  max cmodel rmag allowed in the sdss training set
    zmin,zmax: min and max allowed z in training sets

weights-{wrun}.json
    wrun: An id for this run of the weights code.
    train_sample:
    n_near1: number of nearest neighbors for first pass. e.g. 5. used
        to cull photo sample.
    n_near2: second pass. e.g. 100

pofz-{sample}.json
    pzrun: An id for this run of the p(z) code
    wlrun: The wlrun the weights file is taken from.
    nz: number of grid points
    zmin,zmax: these are zmin,zmax for the p(z) grid, different from the train
        config.
    res: a resolution parameter. this should match n_near2 for no smoothing.
         1 is infinite smoothing.
