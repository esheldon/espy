- nfit-17
    - trying cosmos prior.
        - notes before run
            - efficiency is much lower, factor of two.
            - looking at the shapes I get from the noisefree runs, it seems the
              prior I have (from lackner) is also not correct, or at least does
              not match what I find.  If this run looks a bit better, we might
              try refitting the prior.
        - looks the same at high s/n
- nfit-old04
    - mcmc, cosmos prior, prior *not during*, TwoSidedErf on others
    - notes before run
        - I noticed that even the noisefree ones had significantly wrong shape,
          and it turns out the sensitivity correction from nfit-02 was close to
          what was needed to correct it!  So odd.
        - So I'm rerunning with close to what I did in nfit-02, most noteworthy
          being no g prior during. If it works maybe the problem is prior
          during is just not sampling wide enough.  this would also imply that
          isample needs to be done without prior during.
        - will surprise me a bit, since the difference wasn't that big in the
          nsim runs I did, but note I only tried for high s/n and tight pdfs
