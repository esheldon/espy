ideas about psf:

    - fit 1 gauss then 2 gauss then 3 gauss and pick the one for which
      the probability of the fit is highest
    - fit n gaussians and then take the average parameters from all fits instead
      of a random psf star
    - use brighter stars

mixmc-r01
    - using the old gprior
    - using EM and two gaussians
    - taking a random PSF star

mixmc-r01
    - same as r01 but with gexp and gdev priors based on the bright galaxies
