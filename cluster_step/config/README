    - look at p4 for run 02

ideas about psf:

    - does co-centric make it more stable?
    - fit 1 gauss then 2 gauss then 3 gauss and pick the one for which the
      probability of the fit is highest.  Problem is different stars will end
      up with different number of gaussians, see below.

    - fit n gaussians and then take the average parameters from all fits
      instead of a random psf star.   This can be paired with the above.

    - use brighter stars

    - try using the mcmc fitter
        - coellip full with N gauss
        - gturb 
            - might be that comparing 1 gauss, 2 gauss, and turb will
            cover it


mixmc-r01
    - using the old gprior
    - using EM and two gaussians
    - taking a random PSF star

mixmc-r01
    - same as r01 but with gexp and gdev priors based on the bright galaxies
