- I seem to be having problems at high S/N, actually fairly
    wildly different at different s/n thresholds.  Is it the
    prior or an mcmc convergence issue?

    - look at some mcmc plots for high s/n objects

todo
    - add linear size ratio
        sratio = sqrt(1/s2)

ideas about psf:

    * does co-centric make it more stable?
        - yes but not a better fit
    * fit 1 gauss then 2 gauss then 3 gauss and pick the one for which the
      probability of the fit is highest on average.  Also added turb.

    * fit n gaussians and then take the average parameters from all fits
      instead of a random psf star.   This can be paired with the above.
        - implemented but not tested yet

    - use brighter stars



mixmc-r01
    - using the old gprior
    - using EM and two gaussians
    - taking a random PSF star

mixmc-r02
    - same as r01 but with gexp and gdev priors based on the bright galaxies

mixmc-r03
    - same as r02 but using best psf model.
    - still random draw

mixmc-r04
    - median model
        - does look better
