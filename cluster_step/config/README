* I seem to be having problems at high S/N, upped the number
    of walkers which looks better.  running p1 from mixmc-r05

    - got rid of the bad burnins, but the average bias is basically unchanged

- look at high s/n objects
    - fixed bounding boxes but probably won't make a diff
    - mixmc-r06
- run with admom psf
    - mixmc-r07
- use aic instead of prob since prob can be identically zero
    - affects high s/n more
    - r08


- got some shapes from julia.  Do fits.

    - add linear size ratio
        sratio = sqrt(1/s2)

ideas about psf:

    * does co-centric make it more stable?
        - yes but not a better fit
    * fit 1 gauss then 2 gauss then 3 gauss and pick the one for which the
      probability of the fit is highest on average.  Also added turb.
        - generally em2 is better.  Will compare to pure admom as well

    * fit n gaussians and then take the average parameters from all fits
      instead of a random psf star.   This can be paired with the above.
        - implemented but not tested yet

    - use brighter stars



mixmc-r01
    - using the old gprior
    - using EM and two gaussians
    - taking a random PSF star

mixmc-r02
    - same as r01 but with gexp and gdev priors based on the bright galaxies

mixmc-r03
    - same as r02 but using best psf model.
    - still random draw

mixmc-r04
    - median model
        - does look better
mixmc-r05
    - nwalkers==40
    - ran p1
    * This cuts out the burnin problems but overall bias is
        really unchanged.

mixmc-r06
    - include all segmap pixels, plus 5 pixel padding
    - running p1-s8
mixmc-r07
    - admom psf
    - running p1-s8
mixmc-r08
    - use aic
    - running p1-s8
