- REDO gprior stuff
    - use fewer bins for dev, as we did for sprior
    - use sqrt(n) errors
    * variable binsize
    - figure out why it is worse with the split

- try cutting mag to SDSS vs. hst

- try LM PSF fitting (psf4 shear4)
    - r15 looks better in some ways.  But still biased high at high s/n 
        also very biased in the shear component that should be zero
            - try one gauss?  Try getting best fit from different
            random starts?
    - r16 gmix1
        looks almost the same
    - r17
        don't use full seg region

- double walkers (psf1 shear4)
- non-linear fitting at high S/N?  Tried it
    before and it sucked

- try doing admom with sub-pixel fit, get median model, and then for each
  galaxy render at the best centroid location.  will need to fix the centroid
  with a tight prior

* I seem to be having problems at high S/N, upped the number
    of walkers which looks better.  running p1 from mixmc-r05

    - got rid of the bad burnins, but the average bias is basically unchanged


ideas about psf:

    * does co-centric make it more stable?
        - yes but not a better fit
    * fit 1 gauss then 2 gauss then 3 gauss and pick the one for which the
      probability of the fit is highest on average.  Also added turb.
        - generally em2 is better.  Will compare to pure admom as well

    * fit n gaussians and then take the average parameters from all fits
      instead of a random psf star.   This can be paired with the above.
        - implemented but not tested yet

    - use brighter stars


mixmc-r01
    - using the old gprior
    - using EM and two gaussians
    - taking a random PSF star

mixmc-r02
    - same as r01 but with gexp and gdev priors based on the bright galaxies

mixmc-r03
    - same as r02 but using best psf model.
    - still random draw

mixmc-r04
    - median model
        - does look better

mixmc-r05
    - nwalkers==40
    - ran p1
    * This cuts out the burnin problems but overall bias is
        really unchanged.

mixmc-r06
    - include all segmap pixels plus 5 pixel padding
    - running p1-s8

mixmc-r07
    - admom psf, ran p1-p5
    - retro-added aic and rerun
    - this is always worse

mixmc-r08
    - same as r06 but use aic
    - running p1-s8

mixmc-r09
    - em2 only

mixmc-r10
    - prior vs mag
mixmc-r11
    - prior vs mag but more bins in mag
mixmc-r12
    - using coellip 2 gauss from gmix fit for psf

mixmc-r13
    - do admom with sub-pixel and then render psf at the correct pixel gmix2
      psf.  Looks about the same
mixmc-r14:
    - nwalkers = 40

mixmc-r15
    - lm fitter, gmix2 psf

mixmc-r16
    - lm fitter, gmix1 psf
    - running again with 4 random tries per
        - made little difference
    - same as above but drawing from prior

mixmc-r17
    - don't grow out beyond minimal box
        - next step will be to actually trim where
            the model is < nsigma*skysig and rerun

mixmc-r18
    - tried using prior in likelihood; the shear was
    biased very *high*

mixmc-r19
    - same as r17 but using admom.  See no difference really

mixmc-r20
    - using different priors for exp and dev.  This looks worse
    than r11 to me.
