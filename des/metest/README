This stuff is mostly obsolete, see ../compare_serun_merun.py

no prep needed
    Plot average as a function of x.  Works on both me and se runs
        col-binplot.py run x y1 y2 ...

Cutouts of high s2n
    First do this
        make-high-s2n.py run s2nmin
    Then make cutouts
        make-cutouts.sh run s2nmin

Matching needed
    Do these first
        Make ra/dec list for the me and se runs
            make-radec-list.py run
        Match ra/dec lists
            domatch.sh merun serun

    Plot position differences
        plot-match-posdiff.py merun serun
        plot-match-sheardiff.py merun serun
