After HDFS loss
-----------------

scat-08 is a new version of basically regauss scat-06 which was lost when hdfs
was lost.

redmapper 5.10
---------------

TODO
    - tell matt which cuts to make and which columns to use
    - second best center with default source catalog
    - run with a higher s/n source catalog
    - run a purely uniform random set just to look at additive systematics

The label * means not yet run

- lcat-rm06
    - redmapper 5.10 best center
* lcat-rm07 running
    - redmapper 5.10 second best center
    - run
    - bin
    * match randoms
    * correct

- run-rm06s08
    - redmapper rm06 with scat 08 
* run-rm07s08
    - redmapper rm07 with scat 08

- lcat-rmrand02
    - redmapper 5.10 randoms

* lcat-sdssrand04
    - truly uniform randoms with redshifts that go with redmapper 5.10


I did some tests and using larger pixels in healpix
is actually OK, and saves lots of memory in the case
where we load all the pixels (hadoop)

nside = [64,128,256,512,1024,4096]
time  = [39, 37, 38, 39,  45, 134]



Note lcat-07 should be thought of as lcat-proper01
    this has no strict edgecut, only the quad cut
And run-08 should be thought of as run-proper01

Run run-r01 should be thought of as run-sdssrand01 It uses lcat-sdssrand01,
which has no strict edgecut, only the quad cut
This random run can be used for run-08
