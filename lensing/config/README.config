I did some tests and using larger pixels in healpix
is actually OK, and saves lots of memory in the case
where we load all the pixels (hadoop)

nside = [64,128,256,512,1024,4096]
time  = [39, 37, 38, 39,  45, 134]



Note lcat-07 should be thought of as lcat-proper01
    this has no strict edgecut, only the quad cut
And run-08 should be thought of as run-proper01

Run run-r01 should be thought of as run-sdssrand01 It uses lcat-sdssrand01,
which has no strict edgecut, only the quad cut
This random run can be used for run-08
