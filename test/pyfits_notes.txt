Need better doc string for main pyfits module.

Need to support retrieval of data with
  d['field']
as well as
  d.field('field')
This is the standard access method for arrays
with fields.

Related is the need to support output of ordinary 
inhomogeneous python arrays. e.g.

>>> a
array([([1L, 2L], 3), ([4L, 5L], 6)], 
      dtype=[('arr', '>u4', 2), ('sca', '>i4')])
>>> pyfits.writeto('~/tmp/test.fit', a)
[SNIP]
KeyError: 'data must be numarray or table data.'

It should be simple for the program to realize this is
a normal array with fields and convert it to what
is needed for output.
