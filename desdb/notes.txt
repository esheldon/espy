Currently we can select files by release, which is very convienient.

When we are in the middle of an observing run we will still
want to copy the data to BNL as soon as it is available.

But we won't have an official release of red and coadd images until much later.
Rather we will just have nites, and I expect we could be many different
processings of a given nite.  At the beginning these could appear in rapid
succession as bugs are squashed and features added.

How will we know when a nite is ready to download?  

Should we expect a "rolling release" situation?  For example, perhaps we can
monitor the database for "red" and "coadd" runs that are marked as ready?
