You are not closing your statements, and it turns out they don't close
themselves automatically.  Eventually you run out of statements, since there is
a fixed limit.

The problem is do_query() which returns the results but not the statement.  I
think this is a flaw in how the java wrapping is implemented; the garbage
collection is never releasing those.

I'm testing of the cx_Oracle one has this problem.
